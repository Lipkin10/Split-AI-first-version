## Languages to Translate

The following language files need the above translations added:

- [ ] `de-DE.json` (German)
- [ ] `es.json` (Spanish)
- [ ] `fi.json` (Finnish)
- [ ] `fr-FR.json` (French)
- [ ] `it-IT.json` (Italian)
- [ ] `nl-NL.json` (Dutch)
- [ ] `pl-PL.json` (Polish)
- [ ] `pt-BR.json` (Portuguese Brazil)
- [ ] `ro.json` (Romanian)
- [ ] `ru-RU.json` (Russian)
- [ ] `tr-TR.json` (Turkish)
- [ ] `ua-UA.json` (Ukrainian)
- [ ] `zh-CN.json` (Chinese Simplified)
- [ ] `zh-TW.json` (Chinese Traditional)

## Translation Guidelines

1. **Maintain Placeholders**: Keep placeholders like `{name}`, `{amount}`, `{count}` exactly as they are
2. **Plural Forms**: Use appropriate plural forms for each language
3. **Cultural Context**: Adapt phrases to be natural in each language
4. **Currency**: Consider local currency formatting preferences
5. **Emojis**: Emojis are generally universal, but consider cultural appropriateness

## Implementation

Once translations are added, the balance query feature will automatically work in all supported languages based on the user's locale setting.
