## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 1.2:** Enhanced OpenAI integration provides robust conversational AI backend with 3-second timeout enforcement, comprehensive multi-language support, and excellent error handling. The implementation includes specialized intent classifiers and cultural context awareness that this UI component will leverage. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.enhanced-openai-integration.md#dev-agent-record]

### Component Architecture Requirements

**Design System Integration:** Use existing shadcn/ui component patterns with forwardRef, TypeScript interfaces, and CVA (class-variance-authority) for variant styling. Follow established Button and Input component patterns. [Source: docs/BROWNFIELD_ARCHITECTURE.md#technology-stack]

**Layout Integration Points:**

- **Root Layout:** Integrate into fixed header area or as floating interface in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Group Context:** Leverage existing CurrentGroupProvider for group-scoped conversations in `src/app/groups/[groupId]/layout.client.tsx`
- **Theme Integration:** Use existing ThemeProvider with dark/light mode support
- **Z-index Management:** Header uses z-50, ensure conversational interface respects existing stacking context

[Source: src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/groups/[groupId]/layout.client.tsx]

### State Management Patterns

**Context Providers:** Follow existing patterns using React Context for conversation state management. Integrate with CurrentGroupProvider when in group context for group-scoped conversations. [Source: src/app/groups/[groupId]/current-group-context.tsx]

**Data Fetching:** Use tRPC patterns with React Query for AI conversation endpoints implemented in Story 1.2. Leverage existing error handling and loading state patterns. [Source: docs/BROWNFIELD_ARCHITECTURE.md#api-integration-points]

### Internationalization Requirements

**Multi-language Support:** Integrate with existing next-intl system supporting 15 languages (en-US, de-DE, es, fi, fr-FR, it-IT, nl-NL, pl-PL, pt-BR, ro, ru-RU, tr-TR, ua-UA, zh-CN, zh-TW). Add conversation interface strings to JSON message files in `messages/` directory. [Source: docs/BROWNFIELD_ARCHITECTURE.md#internationalization]

**Cultural Context:** Leverage cultural context awareness from Story 1.2 AI implementation for appropriate conversation prompts and examples per language/region. [Source: src/lib/ai-conversation.ts]

### File Locations and Project Structure

**Component Location:** `src/components/conversational-interface.tsx` (main component)
**Subcomponents:** `src/components/conversation-history.tsx`, `src/components/conversation-input.tsx`
**Types:** `src/lib/ai-conversation/types.ts` (extend existing types from Story 1.2)
**Test Files:** `src/components/__tests__/conversational-interface.test.tsx`
**Message Files:** Add keys to all 15 JSON files in `messages/` directory

[Source: docs/BROWNFIELD_ARCHITECTURE.md#technical-constraints]

### Performance and Security Considerations

**Response Time:** Maintain 3-second timeout compliance established in Story 1.2
**Memory Management:** Implement proper cleanup for conversation history to prevent memory leaks
**Error Handling:** Follow existing error handling patterns with toast notifications using useToast hook
**Rate Limiting:** Respect OpenAI client rate limiting from existing implementation

[Source: docs/stories/1.2.enhanced-openai-integration.md#performance-considerations]

### Integration Verification Requirements

**IV1:** Traditional navigation and UI elements remain fully accessible  
**IV2:** Component doesn't interfere with existing page layouts or functionality  
**IV3:** Performance impact on page load times is minimal  
**IV4:** All existing keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features continue working

[Source: docs/prd/epic-1-conversational-ai-enhancement-for-spliit.md#story-1.3]

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test Framework:** Jest with Next.js integration using jsdom test environment as configured in `jest.config.ts`
**Test Location:** `src/components/__tests__/conversational-interface.test.tsx`
**Mock Patterns:** Follow existing OpenAI mocking patterns from `

- **Why**: The path parsing logic has potential for reuse and should follow DRY principles
- **How**: Moving to `src/lib/utils.ts` improves testability and code organization

**Enhanced Help System**

- **File**: `src/components/conversational-interface.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced basic toast help with structured help tooltip content
- **Why**: Users need more comprehensive guidance for conversational interaction
- **How**: Expanded help translations and improved help trigger UX

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ Excellent adherence to React best practices, TypeScript conventions, and component patterns
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Perfect file organization following established `src/components/` structure with proper test placement
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ Comprehensive Jest test suite with 13 passing tests covering all major functionality
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] **Extracted path parsing utility** (src/lib/utils.ts) - improves code reusability
- [x] **Enhanced help system implementation** (src/components/conversational-interface.tsx) - better user guidance
- [x] **Validated test coverage completeness** (src/components/**tests**/conversational-interface.test.tsx) - 13/13 tests passing

### Security Review

**PASSED** - No security concerns identified. Implementation properly handles:

- Input sanitization through React's built-in XSS protection
- Proper data validation and error boundaries
- Secure sessionStorage usage with appropriate cleanup
- No exposure of sensitive data in error messages

### Performance Considerations

**EXCELLENT** - Implementation demonstrates strong performance awareness:

- Efficient re-rendering with strategic useCallback usage
