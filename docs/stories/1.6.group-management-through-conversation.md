# Story 1.6: Group Management Through Conversation

<!-- Source: Epic 1: Conversational AI Enhancement for Spliit -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to existing group management system -->

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to say "Create a new group for our Vegas trip" and have it set up automatically,  
**so that** I can efficiently manage multiple expense groups.

## Context Source

- **Source Document**: docs/prd/epic-1-conversational-ai-enhancement-for-spliit.md
- **Enhancement Type**: Conversational interface for existing group management system
- **Existing System Impact**: Integration with current group creation, editing, and navigation logic

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AI interprets group creation requests** and extracts group name and initial participants
2. **Existing group creation interface populated** with AI suggestions for confirmation
3. **Support for group member addition/removal** through conversation
4. **Group settings and preferences manageable** through natural language
5. **Integration with existing group management** and permissions system
6. **Group switching and navigation** through conversational commands

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: All existing group management functionality preserved  
**IV2**: Group permissions and access controls unchanged  
**IV3**: Multi-group workflows continue operating correctly  
**IV4**: Group sharing and invitation features remain intact

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

[Source: Analysis of src/trpc/routers/groups/, src/app/groups/, src/components/group-form.tsx]

**Current Group Management System:**
- **Group Creation**: `/groups/create` with GroupForm component using groupFormSchema validation
- **Group APIs**: tRPC router with create, update, get, list, getDetails procedures
- **Group Form**: Handles name, currency, participants with existing validation
- **Group Context**: Active group management in `current-group-context.tsx`
- **Group Navigation**: Recent groups in localStorage, group header with tabs

**Current Conversation Infrastructure:**
- **AI Intent Classification**: Existing `parseIntent` mutation in conversational-interface.tsx
- **Conversation Context**: ConversationProvider manages conversation state and history
- **Multi-language Support**: All 15 languages supported with localized prompts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for AI service failures

### Integration Approach

**Phase 1: Extend AI Intent Classification for Group Management**
```typescript
// src/lib/ai-conversation/types.ts - Extend GroupManagementIntent
interface GroupManagementIntent {
  action: 'create_group' | 'add_participant' | 'remove_participant' | 'update_group' | 'switch_group' | 'list_groups'
  groupName?: string
  participants?: string[]
  currency?: string
  groupId?: string
  settings?: {
    information?: string
    currency?: string
  }
  confidence: number
}
```

**Phase 2: Create Group Management Conversation Patterns**
```typescript
// src/lib/ai-conversation/group-management-patterns.ts (new file)
// Pattern matching for group management requests:
- "Create a new group for [trip/event name]"
- "Add [participant names] to the group"
- "Remove [participant name] from [group name]"
- "Switch to [group name]"
- "Show me all my groups"
- "Change group currency to [currency]"
- "Update group information"
```

**Phase 3: Create Group Management Response Component**
```typescript
// src/components/conversational-group-response.tsx (new file)
// Reuses existing GroupForm and group management components
// Handles AI-extracted data population and confirmation workflows
```

**Phase 4: Integrate with Existing Conversation Interface**
```typescript
// src/components/conversational-interface.tsx (existing)
// Add group management query handling to existing conversation flow
// Maintain conversation context while supporting group operations
```

### Technical Constraints

**Data Integrity**: Group creation must maintain existing validation rules and participant relationships  
**Performance**: Group management response times must be under 2 seconds  
**Context Window**: Maintain conversation history using existing ConversationProvider approach  
**Multi-language**: Support all 15 existing languages using current i18n infrastructure  
**Navigation**: Group switching must work with existing routing and context management

### Conversation Context Integration

[Source: Analysis of src/components/conversation-context.tsx, conversational-interface.tsx]

**Existing Context Management:**
- **Session Storage**: Automatic persistence of conversation history
- **Message Tracking**: Current conversation state with group-specific context
- **Context Cleanup**: Proper cleanup when switching conversation types

**Implementation Strategy:**
```typescript
// Extend existing ConversationProvider to include group management context
interface GroupManagementContext {
  currentGroupOperations: GroupManagementIntent[]
  recentGroupMentions: string[]
  pendingGroupActions: PendingAction[]
  lastGroupOperation?: Date
}
```

### Basic Conversational Patterns

**Supported Patterns:**
1. **Group Creation**: "Create a new group for [event]" / "Start a group called [name]"
2. **Participant Management**: "Add [names] to the group" / "Remove [name] from [group]"
3. **Group Navigation**: "Switch to [group name]" / "Show me [group name]"
4. **Group Settings**: "Change currency to euros" / "Update group information"
5. **Group Listing**: "Show me all my groups" / "What groups do I have?"

**Fallback Patterns:**
- **Unclear Intent**: "I'm not sure what group operation you want. You can say things like: 'Create a new group for [event]' or 'Add [names] to the group'."
- **Unknown Group**: "I don't see a group called '[name]'. Your current groups are: [list]"
- **Ambiguous Action**: "Could you clarify if you want to create, update, or switch to a group?"

**Help Commands:**
- **"/group-help"**: Show available group management patterns
- **"/show-groups"**: Direct link to groups list view
- **"/create-group"**: Quick shortcut to group creation

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

**Primary Risk**: Conversation context becoming confusing when mixing group management with other operations  
**Mitigation**: Clear context separation and operation type indicators  
**Verification**: Test multi-intent conversations with clear operation boundaries

**Secondary Risk**: AI misinterpreting group names or participant names leading to incorrect operations  
**Mitigation**: Strong validation and confirmation prompts for group operations  
**Verification**: Test with similar group names and common participant name patterns

### Rollback Plan

- Feature-flag conversational group management to allow instant disable
- Existing group management UI remains fully functional and accessible
- Conversation history can be cleared without affecting group data
- Traditional navigation to group management preserved

### Safety Checks

- [ ] Existing group management logic tested before any changes
- [ ] Group creation and update operations verified against traditional UI results
- [ ] Conversation context limited to prevent memory overflow
- [ ] AI service failures gracefully degrade to manual group management

## QA Results

### Review Date: January 8, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation demonstrates solid architecture with good separation of concerns. The group management patterns are well-structured with regex-based matching for fast intent classification, falling back to AI when needed. The conversational interface integration is clean and maintains existing patterns. TypeScript types are properly defined and the component structure follows React best practices with proper state management and error handling.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/lib/ai-conversation/group-management-patterns.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed duplicate "usd" pattern in currency extraction and added currency symbols ($, €, £)
  - **Why**: The original pattern had "usd" repeated twice, missing actual currency symbols
  - **How**: Improved pattern matching accuracy for currency detection in natural language

- **File**: `src/components/__tests__/conversational-group-response.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added missing `createdAt` property to mock `currentGroup` object
  - **Why**: TypeScript compilation was failing due to missing required property in Group interface
  - **How**: Added proper date string to satisfy type requirements and ensure tests compile correctly

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows React hooks patterns, proper TypeScript usage, and consistent naming conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Files are placed in appropriate directories matching existing patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive component tests cover all major functionality and edge cases
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria implemented with proper integration

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed currency pattern duplication for better pattern matching accuracy
- [x] Resolved TypeScript compilation errors in test files
- [x] Verified all conversational group response tests pass (11/11 passing)
- [x] Confirmed integration with existing conversation interface maintains compatibility
- [x] Validated proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [x] Ensured multi-language support structure is in place

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly validates input parameters, uses existing tRPC mutations for data persistence, and includes appropriate error handling without exposing sensitive information. Group operations are properly scoped to current user context.

### Performance Considerations

Pattern matching implementation uses efficient regex-based classification before falling back to AI, reducing API calls and improving response times. Component uses React optimization patterns (useMemo, useCallback) to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Group management operations leverage existing optimized tRPC procedures.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation successfully delivers all acceptance criteria with high code quality, comprehensive test coverage, and proper integration with existing systems. The conversational group management feature is production-ready.
