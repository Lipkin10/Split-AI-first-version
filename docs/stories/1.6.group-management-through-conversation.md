# Story 1.6: Group Management Through Conversation

<!-- Source: Epic 1: Conversational AI Enhancement for Spliit -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to existing group management system -->

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to say "Create a new group for our Vegas trip" and have it set up automatically,  
**so that** I can efficiently manage multiple expense groups.

## Context Source

- **Source Document**: docs/prd/epic-1-conversational-ai-enhancement-for-spliit.md
- **Enhancement Type**: Conversational interface for existing group management system
- **Existing System Impact**: Integration with current group creation, editing, and navigation logic

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AI interprets group creation requests** and extracts group name and initial participants
2. **Existing group creation interface populated** with AI suggestions for confirmation
3. **Support for group member addition/removal** through conversation
4. **Group settings and preferences manageable** through natural language
5. **Integration with existing group management** and permissions system
6. **Group switching and navigation** through conversational commands

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: All existing group management functionality preserved  
**IV2**: Group permissions and access controls unchanged  
**IV3**: Multi-group workflows continue operating correctly  
**IV4**: Group sharing and invitation features remain intact

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

[Source: Analysis of src/trpc/routers/groups/, src/app/groups/, src/components/group-form.tsx]

**Current Group Management System:**
- **Group Creation**: `/groups/create` with GroupForm component using groupFormSchema validation
- **Group APIs**: tRPC router with create, update, get, list, getDetails procedures
- **Group Form**: Handles name, currency, participants with existing validation
- **Group Context**: Active group management in `current-group-context.tsx`
- **Group Navigation**: Recent groups in localStorage, group header with tabs

**Current Conversation Infrastructure:**
- **AI Intent Classification**: Existing `parseIntent` mutation in conversational-interface.tsx
- **Conversation Context**: ConversationProvider manages conversation state and history
- **Multi-language Support**: All 15 languages supported with localized prompts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for AI service failures

### Integration Approach

**Phase 1: Extend AI Intent Classification for Group Management**
```typescript
// src/lib/ai-conversation/types.ts - Extend GroupManagementIntent
interface GroupManagementIntent {
  action: 'create_group' | 'add_participant' | 'remove_participant' | 'update_group' | 'switch_group' | 'list_groups'
  groupName?: string
  participants?: string[]
  currency?: string
  groupId?: string
  settings?: {
    information?: string
    currency?: string
  }
  confidence: number
}
```

**Phase 2: Create Group Management Conversation Patterns**
```typescript
// src/lib/ai-conversation/group-management-patterns.ts (new file)
// Pattern matching for group management requests:
- "Create a new group for [trip/event name]"
- "Add [participant names] to the group"
- "Remove [participant name] from [group name]"
- "Switch to [group name]"
- "Show me all my groups"
- "Change group currency to [currency]"
- "Update group information"
```

**Phase 3: Create Group Management Response Component**
```typescript
// src/components/conversational-group-response.tsx (new file)
// Reuses existing GroupForm and group management components
// Handles AI-extracted data population and confirmation workflows
```

**Phase 4: Integrate with Existing Conversation Interface**
```typescript
// src/components/conversational-interface.tsx (existing)
// Add group management query handling to existing conversation flow
// Maintain conversation context while supporting group operations
```

### Technical Constraints

**Data Integrity**: Group creation must maintain existing validation rules and participant relationships  
**Performance**: Group management response times must be under 2 seconds  
**Context Window**: Maintain conversation history using existing ConversationProvider approach  
**Multi-language**: Support all 15 existing languages using current i18n infrastructure  
**Navigation**: Group switching must work with existing routing and context management

### Conversation Context Integration

[Source: Analysis of src/components/conversation-context.tsx, conversational-interface.tsx]

**Existing Context Management:**
- **Session Storage**: Automatic persistence of conversation history
- **Message Tracking**: Current conversation state with group-specific context
- **Context Cleanup**: Proper cleanup when switching conversation types

**Implementation Strategy:**
```typescript
// Extend existing ConversationProvider to include group management context
interface GroupManagementContext {
  currentGroupOperations: GroupManagementIntent[]
  recentGroupMentions: string[]
  pendingGroupActions: PendingAction[]
  lastGroupOperation?: Date
}
```

### Basic Conversational Patterns

**Supported Patterns:**
1. **Group Creation**: "Create a new group for [event]" / "Start a group called [name]"
2. **Participant Management**: "Add [names] to the group" / "Remove [name] from [group]"
3. **Group Navigation**: "Switch to [group name]" / "Show me [group name]"
4. **Group Settings**: "Change currency to euros" / "Update group information"
5. **Group Listing**: "Show me all my groups" / "What groups do I have?"

**Fallback Patterns:**
- **Unclear Intent**: "I'm not sure what group operation you want. You can say things like: 'Create a new group for [event]' or 'Add [names] to the group'."
- **Unknown Group**: "I don't see a group called '[name]'. Your current groups are: [list]"
- **Ambiguous Action**: "Could you clarify if you want to create, update, or switch to a group?"

**Help Commands:**
- **"/group-help"**: Show available group management patterns
- **"/show-groups"**: Direct link to groups list view
- **"/create-group"**: Quick shortcut to group creation

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

**Primary Risk**: Conversation context becoming confusing when mixing group management with other operations  
**Mitigation**: Clear context separation and operation type indicators  
**Verification**: Test multi-intent conversations with clear operation boundaries

**Secondary Risk**: AI misinterpreting group names or participant names leading to incorrect operations  
**Mitigation**: Strong validation and confirmation prompts for group operations  
**Verification**: Test with similar group names and common participant name patterns

### Rollback Plan

- Feature-flag conversational group management to allow instant disable
- Existing group management UI remains fully functional and accessible
- Conversation history can be cleared without affecting group data
- Traditional navigation to group management preserved

### Safety Checks

- [ ] Existing group management logic tested before any changes
- [ ] Group creation and update operations verified against traditional UI results
- [ ] Conversation context limited to prevent memory overflow
- [ ] AI service failures gracefully degrade to manual group management

## Testing

### Test Framework

- **Unit Tests**: Jest for group management intent classification and response formatting
- **Integration Tests**: Test conversation flow with real group data
- **Component Tests**: Verify conversational group response component rendering
- **E2E Tests**: Full conversation scenarios with group management operations

### Required Test Coverage

**Group Management Intent Classification Tests:**
- Group name and participant extraction from natural language
- Multi-language support for all 15 languages
- Ambiguous request handling and clarification responses
- Edge cases with special characters and long names

**Conversation Context Tests:**
- Group operation context maintenance across conversation
- Context cleanup when switching between operation types
- Persistence across browser sessions
- Memory usage limits and conversation history management

**Integration Tests:**
- Group creation accuracy preservation compared to manual creation
- Participant management operations working correctly
- Existing group UI compatibility
- Error handling and fallback scenarios

**Performance Tests:**
- Group management response times under 2 seconds
- Conversation context memory usage
