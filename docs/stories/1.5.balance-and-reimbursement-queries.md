# Story 1.5: Balance and Reimbursement Queries

<!-- Source: Epic 1: Conversational AI Enhancement for Spliit -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to existing balance and reimbursement system -->

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to ask "How much does John owe me?" and get instant answers,  
**so that** I can quickly check balances without navigating through the app.

## Context Source

- **Source Document**: docs/prd/epic-1-conversational-ai-enhancement-for-spliit.md
- **Enhancement Type**: Conversational query interface for existing balance system
- **Existing System Impact**: Integration with current balance calculation and display logic

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AI accurately interprets balance queries** and identifies specific users or general balance requests
2. **Responses displayed using existing balance display components** (BalancesList, ReimbursementList)
3. **Support for reimbursement status queries** ("Did John pay me back?")
4. **Historical balance queries with date ranges** when users specify time periods
5. **Multiple response formats** (specific amounts, balance summaries, recent activity)
6. **Integration with existing balance calculation logic** from src/lib/balances.ts
7. **5-10 message conversation context window** maintained during balance query sessions
8. **Basic conversational patterns supported** with fallback to clarification requests
9. **Help commands available** to guide users out of unclear conversations

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing balance calculations and displays remain unchanged  
**IV2**: Balance accuracy maintained across all query methods  
**IV3**: Real-time balance updates continue working correctly  
**IV4**: Reimbursement tracking functions identically to existing implementation

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

[Source: Analysis of src/app/groups/[groupId]/balances-list.tsx, src/lib/balances.ts, src/app/groups/[groupId]/reimbursement-list.tsx]

**Current Balance Display System:**
- **BalancesList Component**: Displays participant balances with visual bars, handles positive/negative amounts
- **Balance Calculation Logic**: `getBalances()` function in src/lib/balances.ts calculates paid/paidFor/total amounts
- **Reimbursement Logic**: `getSuggestedReimbursements()` provides optimal settlement suggestions
- **ReimbursementList Component**: Shows suggested payments with "Mark as Paid" functionality

**Current Conversation Infrastructure:**
- **AI Intent Classification**: `classifyBalanceQueryIntent()` already exists in src/lib/ai-conversation.ts
- **Conversation Context**: ConversationProvider manages 5-10 message history in sessionStorage
- **Multi-language Support**: All 15 languages supported with localized prompts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for AI service failures

### Integration Approach

**Phase 1: Extend Existing AI Classification**
```typescript
// src/lib/ai-conversation.ts already has classifyBalanceQueryIntent()
// Enhance with specific patterns for balance queries:
- "How much does [participant] owe me?"
- "What's my balance with [participant]?"
- "Who owes money?"
- "Show all balances"
- "Did [participant] pay me back?"
- "What are the suggested reimbursements?"
```

**Phase 2: Create Balance Response Component**
```typescript
// src/components/conversational-balance-response.tsx (new file)
// Reuses existing BalancesList and ReimbursementList components
// Formats AI-extracted data for existing display components
```

**Phase 3: Integrate with Conversation Interface**
```typescript
// src/components/conversational-interface.tsx (existing)
// Add balance query handling to existing conversation flow
// Maintain 5-10 message context window using existing ConversationProvider
```

### Technical Constraints

**Data Integrity**: Balance calculations use integer arithmetic (cents) - must preserve exact precision  
**Performance**: Response times for balance queries must be under 2 seconds  
**Context Window**: Maintain 5-10 previous messages using existing sessionStorage approach  
**Multi-language**: Support all 15 existing languages using current i18n infrastructure  
**Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to traditional balance UI when AI service unavailable

### Conversation Context Window Design

[Source: Analysis of src/components/conversation-context.tsx]

**Existing Context Management:**
- **Session Storage**: Automatic persistence of conversation history
- **Message Limit**: Implement sliding window of 5-10 messages for balance query context
- **Context Cleanup**: Clear context when switching between different query types

**Implementation Strategy:**
```typescript
// Extend existing ConversationProvider to include balance-specific context
interface BalanceQueryContext {
  recentBalanceQueries: ConversationMessage[]
  participantMentions: string[]
  lastBalanceCalculation?: Date
}
```

### Basic Conversational Patterns

**Supported Patterns:**
1. **Direct Balance Query**: "How much does John owe me?"
2. **General Balance Check**: "Show me all balances" / "What are the balances?"
3. **Reimbursement Status**: "Did John pay me back?" / "Who needs to pay?"
4. **Historical Queries**: "What was the balance last week?"
5. **Settlement Suggestions**: "How should we settle up?"

**Fallback Patterns:**
- **Unclear Intent**: "I'm not sure what balance information you're looking for. You can ask things like: 'How much does [name] owe me?' or 'Show me all balances'."
- **Unknown Participant**: "I don't recognize '[name]' in this group. Current participants are: [list]"
- **Ambiguous Query**: "Could you clarify if you want to see individual balances or suggested reimbursements?"

**Help Commands:**
- **"/balance-help"**: Show available balance query patterns
- **"/show-balances"**: Direct link to traditional balance view
- **"/clear-conversation"**: Reset conversation context

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: Good Foundation with Testing Concerns**

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural decisions with comprehensive pattern matching, proper UI component integration, and good separation of concerns. The conversation context management and multi-language support show thoughtful design. However, the testing approach needs significant improvement to ensure reliability.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `src/components/__tests__/conversational-balance-response.test.tsx`
- **Issue**: Mock component testing instead of real component behavior  
- **Why**: Tests provide false confidence by not testing actual UI logic
- **Recommendation**: Replace mock with real component testing using proper Jest setup

**File**: `src/lib/ai-conversation/balance-query-patterns.ts`  
- **Strength**: Excellent confidence scoring and participant matching logic
- **Observation**: Well-structured pattern matching with proper fallback handling

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Clean separation of concerns, proper TypeScript usage
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files organized logically, follows existing patterns  
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ **CRITICAL** - Mock-based testing approach needs major revision
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 9 acceptance criteria successfully implemented

### Security Review

**Authentication**: ✓ No security concerns - leverages existing authentication patterns
**Data Validation**: ✓ Proper participant name validation prevents injection attacks
**API Security**: ✓ Uses existing secure balance calculation methods

### Performance Considerations  

**Response Times**: ✓ Pattern matching is O(n) with early termination - efficient
**Memory Usage**: ✓ 5-10 message sliding window prevents memory leaks  
**Bundle Size**: ✓ No significant impact on build size (verified in build output)

### Critical Testing Issues Found

1. **Mock Component Anti-Pattern**: Tests use `MockConversationalBalanceResponse` instead of real component
2. **Path Resolution Failure**: `@/lib/utils` import fails in test environment  
3. **Missing Integration Tests**: No tests verify real balance calculations with UI
4. **False Test Coverage**: 100% mock test coverage ≠ real component reliability

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] **Code Architecture Review**: Well-designed with proper separation of concerns
- [x] **Pattern Matching Logic**: Comprehensive with confidence scoring  
- [x] **UI Integration**: Properly reuses existing BalancesList/ReimbursementList components
- [x] **Fix Jest Configuration**: Resolved module path resolution and installed missing dependencies
- [x] **Replace Mock Tests**: Created UX-focused test suite testing actual component behavior
- [x] **Add Integration Tests**: Implemented real balance calculation testing with UI validation
- [x] **Add E2E Conversation Tests**: Comprehensive conversation flow testing with follow-up actions
